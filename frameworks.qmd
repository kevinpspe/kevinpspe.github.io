## Causal Questions: Treatment and Outcomes

In causal inference, we are concerned with how a **treatment** (notated $D$) causes some change in the **outcome** variable (notated $Y$).

We generally assume that the treatment variable is **binary**.

$$
D = \begin{cases}
0 \quad \text{You did not receive the treatment} \\
1 \quad \text{You did receive the treatment}
\end{cases}
$$

Note: binary is a variable that can only take two values. For example, flipping a coin is either heads or tails.

## Understanding Causation through Potential Outcomes

Imagine we have two hypothetical parallel worlds that are copies of each other. Both of these worlds are identical except for one aspect: the treatment. In one world, you get the treatment, and in the other parallel world, you do not get the treatment.

The outcome values of these two parallel worlds are called **potential outcomes**:

| Parallel World                      | Potential Outcome |
|:------------------------------------|:------------------|
| Does not Receive Treatment: $D = 0$ | $\C$              |
| Receives Treatment: $D = 1$         | $\T$              |

: The (0) and (1) are not exponents - they label the outcome $Y$ for treatment status. {#tbl-potout tbl-colwidths="\[65,35\]" .bordered}

The two hypothetical parallel worlds are [identical]{.underline} to each other, with the only difference being in one world, you get the treatment. Thus, any difference in outcomes between the two worlds must be the **causal effect** of the treatment (notated $\tau$):

$$
\tau = \T - \C
$$

::: aside
Note: For this to be the causal effect, we need an additional assumption, SUTVA. See [appendix B](details.qmd).

We call this causal effect the **individual treatment effect**.

## The Problem of Counterfactuals

However, in reality, we do not have two parallel worlds. You either get the treatment, or don't get the treatment. Thus, by definition, one of the potential outcomes is not observed in our real world - the one not observed is called the **counterfactual**.

| In the Real World                       | Observed Outcome $Y$ | Counterfactual |
|:---------------------------------|:------------------|:------------------|
| Scenario 1: I receive treatment         | $Y = \T$             | $\Cred$        |
| Scenario 2: I did not receive treatment | $Y = \C$             | $\Tred$        |

: From now on, I will always label counterfactuals in red. {#tbl-observed tbl-colwidths="\[40,35,25\]" .bordered}

The **fundamental problem of causal inference** is that in order to calculate our individual treatment effect $\tau$, we need both potential outcomes. However, we can never observe both.

To find the causal effect, we need to estimate the counterfactuals with an **estimator**. This is difficult at the individual level, so instead, we focus on average treatment effects for groups. There are three main group causal effects:

| Group Effects                                 | Notation           | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|:----------------|:----------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Average Treatment Effect (ATE)                | $\tau_\text{ATE}$  | The average of individual treatment effects $\tau$, for all individuals in our study, including people who did and didn't get the treatment.                                                             |
| Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) | $\tau_\text{ATT}$  | The average of individual treatment effects $\tau$, but only for individuals who receive the treatment in our study. We ignore those who never receive treatment in our study.                           |
| Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)         | $\tau_\text{LATE}$ | The average of individual treatment effects $\tau$, but only for a specific (local) group of individuals in a study. This group is usually defined by some characteristic the individuals hold together. |
