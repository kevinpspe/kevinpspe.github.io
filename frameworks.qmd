# Potential Outcomes

<br />

In causal inference, we are concerned with how a **treatment** (notated $D$) causes some change in the **outcome** variable (notated $Y$).

Imagine we have two hypothetical parallel worlds that are copies of each other. Both of these worlds are identical except for one aspect: the treatment. In one world, you get the treatment, and in the other parallel world, you do not get the treatment:

| Parallel World                                       | Potential Outcome |
|:-----------------------------------------------------|:------------------|
| Individual $i$ Does not Receive Treatment: $D_i = 0$ | $\C$              |
| Individual $i$ Receives Treatment: $D_i = 1$         | $\T$              |

: The (0) and (1) are not exponents - they label the outcome $Y$ for treatment status. {#tbl-potout tbl-colwidths="\[70,30\]" .bordered}

The two hypothetical parallel worlds are [identical]{.underline} to each other, with the only difference being in one world, you get the treatment. Thus, any difference in outcomes between the two worlds must be the **causal effect** of the treatment:

$$
\tau_i = \T - \C
$$

However, in reality, we do not have two parallel worlds. You either get the treatment, or don't get the treatment. Thus, by definition, one of the potential outcomes is not observed in our real world - the one not observed is called the **counterfactual**.

| In the Real World                         | Observed Outcome $Y$ | Counterfactual |
|:---------------------------------|:------------------|:------------------|
| Scenario 1: $i$ receives treatment        | $Y_i = \T$           | $\Cred$        |
| Scenario 2: $i$ did not receive treatment | $Y_i = \C$           | $\Tred$        |

: From now on, I will always label counterfactuals in red. {#tbl-observed tbl-colwidths="\[40,35,25\]" .bordered}

The **fundamental problem of causal inference** is that in order to calculate our individual treatment effect $\tau$, we need both potential outcomes. However, we can never observe both.

<br />

To find the causal effect, we need to estimate the counterfactuals with an **estimator**. This is difficult at the individual level, so instead, we focus on average treatment effects for groups. There are three main group causal effects:

| Group Effects                                 | Notation           | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:------------------------------------|
| Average Treatment Effect (ATE)                | $\tau_\text{ATE}$  | The average of individual treatment effects $\tau$, for all individuals in our study, including people who did and didn't get the treatment.                                                             |
| Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) | $\tau_\text{ATT}$  | The average of individual treatment effects $\tau$, but only for individuals who receive the treatment in our study. We ignore those who never receive treatment in our study.                           |
| Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)         | $\tau_\text{LATE}$ | The average of individual treatment effects $\tau$, but only for a specific (local) group of individuals in a study. This group is usually defined by some characteristic the individuals hold together. |
