This is a collection of resources and notes for political science and political economy that I have collected throughout my postgraduate degree at the London School of Economics

Most of these resources relate around causal inference, statistics, and game theory.

I am continuously adding more to this collection as a learn more. Some parts may be incomplete, and you may see some changes in existing parts.

This isn't meant to teach you stuff - more of a supplement + review + implementation guide so don't use it to self-learn that might not work as well.
