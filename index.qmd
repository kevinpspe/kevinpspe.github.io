# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is a collection of resources and notes for political science and political economy methodology that I have collected throughout my postgraduate degree at the London School of Economics. I hope this resource can be useful to both myself and others!

The resources in this collection include:

-   Causal inference, including details (and modern advancements) on differences-in-differences, regression discontinuity, and selection on observables.
-   Some general content covering regression models.
-   Some content on latent variable (multivariate) models, like factor analysis.

I am continuously adding more to this collection as a learn more. Some parts may be incomplete, and you may see some changes in existing parts.

This isn't meant to teach you stuff - more of a supplement + review + implementation guide so don't use it to self-learn that might not work as well. I'm not a teacher.
